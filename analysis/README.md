## Questions to Answer

1. Correlation between the rating of the anime and the number of episodes (i.e. Does more episodes make the anime better or worse?)

2. How does the duration (number of episodes) affect the completion rate of the anime (i.e. if it is long, how many people end up finishing watching the anime).  

3. Does the premier date affect the number of people who are going to view the anime (i.e. is choosing a date to air the anime going to give it the best chance to become a popular hit)
