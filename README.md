## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic of interest is using basic statistics provided by the anime rankings and digging deeper to explore three main questions.

1. Find the correlation between the rating of the anime and the number of episodes produced: We want to see how the number of episodes of an anime affects its rating.

2. How does the duration of an anime affect the completion rate of the anime: Essentially, we want to see if the more prolonged the anime is, how many people end up sticking with finishing to watch that anime.

3. Does the premier date affect the number of people going to view this anime: To emphasize, we want to see if a particular month the pilot episode of an anime airs affects how the anime will do ranking-wise in the longer term.

We are both interested in this topic because we have been watching anime for many years now. Therefore, this is an opportunity to combine our love of programming and watching anime into one project. In the end, we hope to have a nice user-facing dashboard with this dataset to show off to our future employers while combining both of our passions.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset both of us chose was scrapped off of the website [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/). Hernan Valdivieso scrapped the dataset. A nice feature about this dataset is that it has a CC0: Public Domain License, which means we can modify the dataset. This dataset contains information from different active users on the website "MyAnimeList", including but not limited to animes that users have stopped watching, completed watching, plan to watch, currently watching or on hold. This dataset was collected in 2020 and is constantly being updated. The purpose of this dataset for the person who scrapped it was to explore the different types of recommended animes and filter by various categories. Additionally, this dataset provided an excellent exercise for web scrapping while making these available via HTML files. With this information available, we can use this to build a better anime recommendation system while also answering several questions of interest, as discussed in the [topic of interest section.](#describe-your-topic/interest-in-about-150-200-words)
